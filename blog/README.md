## Usage

These local files serve as backup copies for the main portfolio website. The JavaScript in `script.js` implements a smart fallback system:

1. **Primary**: Always attempts to open the online IAAC blog URL first
2. **Fallback**: If the online version fails to load, automatically opens the local backup copy
3. **User Notification**: Shows a brief notification when falling back to local copies

This ensures users get the most up-to-date content when possible, while maintaining reliability through local backups.

## Notes

- Files contain the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the original blog posts
- Images and other assets may still reference external IAAC servers
- Files are saved exactly as they appeared on the original blog at the time of download
