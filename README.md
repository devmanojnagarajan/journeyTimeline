## What This Portfolio Shows

My career is built on three key stages, each represented by a milestone in the timeline. This summary is presented in reverse-chronological order, starting with my current focus.

### üíª 1. The Leap into Tech: Full Stack Development (2026 & Future)

This stage represents my full commitment to software engineering. My current studies in Computer Science are focused on:

-   **Core Fundamentals:** Mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **System Design (HLD/LLD)**.
-   **Modern Web Stacks:** Building scalable applications using technologies like **React**, **Node.js**, **Python**, and **Go**.
-   **Cloud & Data Engineering:** Working with **AWS**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and designing data pipelines.

### üåâ 2. The Bridge: Computational Design (2024)

This is where my two worlds connected. My Master's in Advanced Architecture was focused on technology.

-   **Code as a Design Tool:** I used **Python**, **C#**, and **JavaScript** for parametric modeling and creating generative art.
-   **Data & AI:** I learned about **AI/ML**, using TensorFlow and computer vision for image generation in an architectural context.
-   **Digital Fabrication:** I gained hands-on experience with 3D printing and CNC machining, turning digital models into physical objects.

### üèõÔ∏è 3. The Foundation in Architecture (2019 & Before)

This period demonstrates my core skills in **design and problem-solving**.

-   **Design Thinking:** I learned to understand complex problems and design user-centered solutions.
-   **Structural Logic:** My training in architecture taught me how to build robust, logical systems.
-   **Visual Communication:** I developed a strong eye for aesthetics, layout, and user experience.

## Skills Demonstrated by This Project Itself

I built this portfolio from scratch to practice and showcase my abilities.

-   **Frontend Development:** The site is built with clean **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, demonstrating my ability to create a responsive and interactive user interface.
-   **UI/UX Design:** The simple layout, clear navigation, and interactive timeline reflect my background in design and my focus on creating a good user experience.
-   **Storytelling:** The timeline structure is a deliberate choice to clearly communicate my professional journey and show how my skills connect and build upon each other.
